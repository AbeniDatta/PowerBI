# PowerBI
World Happiness Report.

A Personal project made with PowerBI. I used the dataset - World Happiness, in which different countries are ranked based on several factors from 2015 to 2019. 
I created charts and visualizations to understand the data and concept better. 

Note: This does not accurately represent the data for all countries in the world and is just a rough visualization made from the data available in the data set.
